## Features

- **Live Partial Evaluation:**  
  As you type an expression, a live evaluation is shown below the expressionâ€”even if the expression is incomplete (e.g., `50+`).

- **Final Calculation:**  
  Press the "=" button to compute the final result using MathJS. The final result is displayed prominently.

- **Interactive History:**  
  All previous calculations are saved in a history panel. Click on any history item to load its expression back into the calculator.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Optimized for mobile and desktop views. On mobile, the history panel appears at the top; on desktop, it is positioned to the left.

- **Neon UI Effects:**  
  Each key has a neon gradient background with a glowing animation for an eye-catching design.

- **Custom Scrollbar:**  
  The horizontal scrollbar for long expressions is styled to match the neon theme of the application.
